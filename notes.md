notes to do

for the container, we need to give it a separate class to add some more effects to it,

design concepts, images laid over text boxes with a color palette driving it.

we need to think of a better way to format out material, espcially the task progress page.

maybe have the information rotate or change,

have them change colors when clicked?

the big banner at the top can have a rotation of images that are chore related, or a task list.
